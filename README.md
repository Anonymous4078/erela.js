# READ ME FIRST

Erela v3 changes a LOT how Erela works and how it's used. To start it is no longer a single package but rather several and usage of Erela depends on what package is being used. Audio providers is the main breaking change where you can use either Lavalink or FFMPEG with your bot and switch at any time with some code changes. Anything from now on out may be changed

## Contributors

Before you want to help, understand this is a bigger project than it was before and is still in early development, help is appreciated but please only help when you 100% know what is going on

## Documentation & Guides

_Out dated at this point, please use with caution_

## Developing

> Note: This is more of a first time setup.

> Note: I also recommend using Yarn over NPM, you can have both installed and use either one but for this project Yarn is preferred.

1. Fork the repository
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn run lerna bootstrap`
4. `yarn run lerna run build`
5. `yarn run lerna run types`
6. `yarn link` the packages you wish to test to your test folder

> Note: This may not be correct as I (Solaris) am using the example bot to test.
