# Erela.JS

This package is the Erela.JS API that providers implement. By itself this does nothing but it's required by any Erela.JS provider to function.

## How it works

Providers are simply different audio players (lavalink, ffmpeg) using the Erela.JS standard. Please view the specific [provider](#providers) to learn how to install it.

## Providers

You can use providers below to play audio to a voice channel with that audio processor.

- [lavalink](https://github.com/Erelajs/lavalink)
- [ffmpeg](https://github.com/Erelajs/ffmpeg)

## Creating your own provider

[Please click here to find out more about creating your own providers.](./pages/providers)

## Plugins

You can use plugins below to extend Erela.js' features easily.

> Note: There are two kinds of plugins, *generic* and *provider*, one will work with any Erela provider and the other may only work with a specific provider.
> Note: These are the only ones shown before being published, check the GitHub repository for a complete list.

- [erela.js-spotify](https://github.com/Erelajs/spotify) - Allows you to search songs on Spotify to play using YouTube.
